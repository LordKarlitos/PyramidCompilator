# Welcome to Pyramid! 
*Pyramid is an abomination, that I call a "programing language", created by no other than me - LordKarlitos.*
## Syntax
The language is still evolving. I will be trying to add new functions and stuff, but it will take time.
As of today, Pyramid includes:
- dump(); - Displays data in console.
